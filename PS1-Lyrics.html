[Intro] <br>
Can anybody find me <br>
Somebody to love? <br>
</p>

<p>
[Verse 1] <br>
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little <br>
Can barely stand on my feet <br>
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry <br>
Take a look in the mirror and cry <br>
Lord, what you're doin' to me? (Yeah, yeah) <br>
I have spent all my years in believin' you <br>
But I just can't get no relief, Lord <br>
</p>

<p>
[Chorus] <br>
Somebody (Somebody) <br>
Ooh, somebody (Somebody) <br>
Can anybody find me <br>
Somebody to love? <br>
Yeah
</p>

<p>
[Verse 2] <br>
I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life <br>
I work 'til I ache my bones <br>
At the end (At the end of the day) I take home <br>
My hard-earned pay all on my own <br>
(Goes home, goes home on his own) <br>
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees) and I start to pray (Praise the Lord) <br>
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord <br>
</p>

<p>
[Chorus] <br>
Somebody (Somebody) <br>
Ooh, somebody (Please) <br>
Can anybody find me <br>
Somebody to love? <br>
Oh <br>
</p>

<p>
[Bridge] <br>
(He works hard) everyday (Everyday) <br>
I try and I try and I try <br>
But everybody wants to put me down <br>
They say I'm goin' crazy <br>
They say I got a lot of water in my brain <br>
I got no common sense <br>
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe <br>
No, no, no, no <br>
</p>

<p>
[Guitar solo]
</p>

<p>
[Chorus] <br>
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord) <br>
Ooh somebody <br>
Ooh (Somebody) <br>
Anybody find me <br>
Somebody to love <br>
Can anybody find me <br>
Someone to love? <br>
</p>

<p>
[Verse 3] <br>
Got no feel, I got no rhythm <br>
I just keep losin' my beat (You just keep losing and losing) <br>
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright) <br>
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah) <br>
I just gotta get out of this prison cell <br>
(One day) Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord <br>
</p>

<p>
[Outro] <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
(Find me, find me) <br>
Find me somebody to love (Find me) <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Find me somebody to love-ove-ove <br>
(Ooh, find me, find me) <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
(Somebody to love) <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
Somebody (Somebody) <br>
Somebody (Somebody) <br>
Somebody (Find me) <br>
(Somebody find me somebody to love) <br>
Can anybody find me <br>
Somebody to love? <br>
(Find me somebody to love) Ooh <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Find me somebody <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Somebody, somebody, somebody to love <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Find me, find me <br>
Find me, find me, find me <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Ooh, somebody to love <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Ooh, find me, find me <br>
Find me somebody to love <br>
(Find me somebody to love) <br>
Anybody, anywhere, anybody <br>
Find me somebody to love, love <br>
Find me, find me, find me, find me <br>
